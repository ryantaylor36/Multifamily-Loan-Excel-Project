For this project, I analyzed a multifamily loan data set.  
First, I cleaned the data removing any null values or unexplained zeros.  
Next I added some calculated fields and conditional formatting.
I created 6 pivot tables to show how loan delinquency has been affected by different factors.
I used these pvito tables to created a dashboard.  I added some slicers to the dashboard as well to allow for filtering.


Key Findings:
Properties with over 100 units had a lower delinqunecy rate than smaller properties.
A couple locations are slight outliers in terms of delinquency rates.  NY had the lowest rate by about 3%, and Arizona was about 2% higher than the next highest state.
Origination year was a much bigger factor than expected according to the data.  The large variance seen here leads me to further explore whether this portion of the data is accurate.
